## Data Management

### Secure Cloud Storage
- **Hierarchical Structure**: `media/{identityId}/file_{uuid}_{filename}` for perfect isolation
- **SaaS Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each user has secure, isolated storage with complete data segregation
- **Intelligent Cleanup**: Automatic file lifecycle management
- **Universal File Support**: All file types supported with intelligent preview
- **File Type Detection**: Automatic file type recognition and appropriate icon display
- **Unique File IDs**: Prevents conflicts with crypto-generated UUIDs
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption at rest and in transit

### Enterprise File Management
- **Perfect S3-DynamoDB Sync**: Files tracked via s3Path in database
- **Smart File Replacement**: Same filename replaces, different filename adds
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Orphaned files removed during updates/deletes
- **File Metadata Tracking**: Size, type, upload timestamp, and original filename
- **Multi-file Operations**: Upload, update, and delete multiple files per note
- **File Type Recognition**: Automatic icons and thumbnails based on file extension

### File Preview System
- **Image Files**: Thumbnail previews with click-to-enlarge functionality
- **Document Files**: Professional file type icons (PDF 📄, Word 📝, Excel 📊)
- **Archive Files**: Archive icons for ZIP, RAR, and other compressed formats
- **Interactive Preview**: Click any file icon or thumbnail to open/download
- **Tooltip Support**: Hover over file icons to see filename information

### Serverless Database Operations

#### **Real-time Synchronization**
- When you create/update/delete a note, **all your devices** see the change instantly
- Uses **WebSocket connections** through AppSync for live updates
- **Example**: Add a note on your phone → it appears on your laptop immediately
- No page refresh needed - changes appear automatically in the UI table

#### **Optimistic Concurrency**
- UI updates **immediately** when you click "Create Note" (before server confirms)
- If there's a conflict, it **automatically resolves** or shows an error
- **Example**: Note appears in table instantly, even if network is slow
- Provides smooth user experience with immediate visual feedback

#### **Resilient Operations**
- If network fails, it **automatically retries** the operation
- Uses **exponential backoff** (waits 1s, then 2s, then 4s, etc.)
- **Example**: Poor WiFi? No problem - it keeps trying until it succeeds
- Failed operations are queued and retried when connection is restored

#### **ACID Compliance in Smart Notes Vault SaaS**
- **Atomicity**: When updating a note with a new file, either both the note AND file update succeed, or both fail
- **Consistency**: User isolation rules are always enforced - you never see another user's notes
- **Isolation**: Multiple users editing notes simultaneously don't interfere with each other
- **Durability**: Once your note is saved, it's permanently stored and won't be lost

**Real-world Example**: When you update a note with a new image:
1. **Atomicity**: Old file is deleted AND new file is uploaded AND database is updated - all or nothing
2. **Consistency**: The note remains owned by you throughout the process
3. **Isolation**: Other users' operations don't affect your update
4. **Durability**: Once complete, your changes are permanently saved

#### **Auto-scaling**
- Handles **1 user or 1 million users** without configuration changes
- **Capacity increases/decreases** automatically based on demand
- **Example**: Black Friday traffic spike? DynamoDB handles it seamlessly
- No performance degradation as your user base grows

#### **Zero Maintenance**
- **No servers to patch** or update - AWS handles everything
- **No database administration** required - no backups, no tuning
- **AWS manages everything** - security updates, monitoring, scaling
- Focus on building features, not managing infrastructure

## File Tracking in S3

### S3 File Structure
Files are stored with this pattern:
```
media/{your-identity-id}/file_{uuid}_{original-filename}
```

### Tracking Methods
1. **AWS Console**: Navigate to S3 bucket → `media/{identity-id}/`
2. **AWS CLI**: `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/media/{identity-id}/`
3. **DynamoDB Cross-Reference**: Each note's `files` array contains exact S3 paths
4. **Browser DevTools**: Monitor network requests for file operations

### File Management Benefits
- ✅ **Unique file IDs** prevent conflicts
- ✅ **Identity isolation** - each user has separate folder
- ✅ **Original filenames preserved** in metadata
- ✅ **Perfect DynamoDB-S3 sync** via s3Path field
